I am a research scientist at Google Brain on [Dale Schuurmans](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~dale/)'s team and a PhD student advised by [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) at UC Berkeley. I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning and representation learning for sequential decision making.

Prior to Brain, I received my M.Eng. and B.S. in computer science from MIT working with [Julian Shun](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/) on high-performance computing for large-scale graphs. I have also worked on interesting computer systems problems such as multi-core inference in TensorFlow TPU and lazy memory allocation in the Android operating system.
