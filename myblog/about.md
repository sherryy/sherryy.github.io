I am a software engineer at Google. I received my bachelor's and master's degree from MIT working with [Prof. Julian Shun](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/). Prior to that, I was an [AFS foreign exchange](https://www.afsusa.org/) student in [Whitethorn, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitethorn,_California). I was born and raised in northwestern China in a city called [Lanzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzhou).
